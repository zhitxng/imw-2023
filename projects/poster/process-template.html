                    Wildfires immediately came to mind when I read the details of this talk. Given its current relevance
                    in the evolution of the climate crisis, I thought it would be fitting to base the design of the site
                    around this topic. Additionally, wood has been an extremely important material when it comes to
                    Architecture, Landscape, and Design.</p>

                <p>I was especially inspired by this image because it has a shockingly beautiful and graphic quality to
                    it, despite being devastating. The colour palette for this project was inspired by these muted
                    tones.
                </p>

                <p> As for typography, I knew I wanted to use a wood type to pay homage to the theme. Champion Gothic
                    Heavyweight was used as it’s a<a
                        href="https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/32720/gothic-nesbitt">‘cleaned-up version’</a> of the
                    original Gothic type cut by Edwin Allen.
                    Paired with Adobe Caslon, it’s meant to showcase the delicacy of nature hidden amongst the
                    ruggedness.

                    The layout was inspired by a news headline in addition to the idea of layers (layers of earth,
                    layers of wood, layers of pollution etc.) Thus, all the elements sort of stack up on top of each
                    other.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The animation overlay was inspired by ash flowing in the wind, I used an animation template off
                    codepen(unfortunately lost the link). The blockiness of the title becomes a great background to
                    bring out these white particles.
